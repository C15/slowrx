{"name":"Slowrx","tagline":"A decoder for Slow-Scanning Television (SSTV).","body":"slowrx\r\n========\r\n\r\nSlowrx is an [SSTV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan%20television) decoder that aims for intuitive simplicity and lack of features not needed by a shortwave listener (SWL).\r\n\r\nCreated by Oona Räisänen OH2EIQ (oh2eiq@sral.fi).\r\n\r\nScreenshot\r\n----------\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/okraisan/shot-slowrx.png)\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Support for a multitude of modes (see `modespec.c` for a list)\r\n* Detect frequency-shifted signals – no need to fine-tune the radio\r\n* Automatic slant correction (compensation for sound card clock error)\r\n* Adaptive noise reduction\r\n* Decode digital FSK ID\r\n* Save received pictures as PNG\r\n* Written in C99\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* Linux\r\n* Alsa\r\n* Gtk+ 3.4\r\n* FFTW 3\r\n* pnglite\r\n\r\nAnd, obviously:\r\n\r\n* shortwave radio with SSB\r\n* computer with sound card\r\n* means of getting sound from one to the other\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe program was inspired by several articles:\r\n\r\n* Barber, JL (N7CXI) (May 2000).
